# Final project guidelines

## The task

After giving an individual presentation on the tools (see the presentation
guidelines), the final project consist in developing a microservice system and
create a DevOps pipeline for its continuous integration and deployment with
testing, monitoring, logging, ...

Nothing is written in stone and for special reasons and motivations the project
can be personalized for the different individuals or groups.

It is recommended that the project is performed in small groups (Amazon 2 pizza
rule!). The formation of groups is decided in a randomic way.

The groups can propose a project to develop. Good candidate projects are those
that involve the development of microservices (potentially using Jolie - but not
a requirement), and use tools for the continuous integration/deployment,
testing, monitor, logging, security of the system.
The tasks to perform to have a minimal
viable project are discussed with the lecturer, that can authorize it.

If a group has no idea or the proposal presents weaknesses, a standard project
will be assigned ex officio.

To pass the exam the students has to:
* conclude a successful presentation of the tools,
* fulfill the task required on the agreed project,
* write in the group the project report (see details below)
* write the individual contribution report (see details below)
* discuss the project

# Code

You have to hand in in a single zip file all the code and the documentation
developed to run the system, run and set up the CI/CD pipeline.

Clear instructions for running the project and setting up the pipeline must be
included in a separate README.md file included in code zip file.

All the member of the group must upload the same zip file.


# Guidelines for the project report

## Packaging

You have to hand in a single zip file on Blackboard, containing:

- a PDF file with the project report (call it "group_report_NUMBER.pdf",
  where NUMBER is your group number);
- a PDF file with your individual report (call it
  "individual_report_NAME_SURNAME.pdf", where NAME and SURNAME should be
  replaced by your name and surname).

## Project Report

All the member of the group must write a unique report detailing the work
perform to implement the project.

### Format

The report must not exceed 20 pages excluding citations. Use 1.5 line spacing
and ensure that the page margins are at least of 2cm (in all directions). For
the body text, use Times new roman as family and 12pt as font size.

The first page of the report must include a title, all the participants of the
group with their SDU e-mail address, the name of the course and the date.

Tip: if you use Latex, you can use the following command (adapt the margins to
your liking, but respect the minimal specifications).
\usepackage[a4paper,top=2.1cm,bottom=2.1cm,left=2.4cm,right=2.4cm]{geometry}

### Structure

The structure below is a guideline for the project description. The main
sections are given in the following list. Feel free to insert subsections as you
see fit.

1 - Introduction.
This section gives an overview of the motivations and results of what you have
done. Describe the challenge that you want to address, motivating why it is
relevant.

2 - Preliminaries.
Give a brief overview of the background knowledge needed to understand your
report. Provide references to what you have used and report the main concepts
that your work is based on.

3 - Technical Description.
Here you explain the technical work you have carried out. You may include code
snippets where relevant, and refer to source code in the project files. Try to
explain the development choices you did taking into account important properties
such as deployability, availability, reusability, security, modifiability,
performance.

4 - Related Work and Discussion.
In this section you review the relevant state of the art. This may include
alternative solutions to the same challenge you have tried to address in your
project, or alternative methodologies that you may have followed (e.g., choice
of other technologies for implementing the project). Provide a discussion on the
implications of your choices in the design of your work and the
technologies/techniques that you have used.

- References (or Bibliography)
This section should contain references to the articles/websites/resources/etc.
cited in your report.


## Individual Contribution Report

All the students have to write an individual contribution report.

### Format

The report must not exceed 2 pages excluding citations. Use 1.5 line spacing
and ensure that the page margins are at least of 2cm (in all directions). For
the body text, use Times new roman as family and 12pt as font size.

The first page of the report must include a title, your name, your SDU e-mail
address, the name of the course and the date.

Tip: if you use Latex, you can use the following command (adapt the margins to
your liking, but respect the minimal specifications).
\usepackage[a4paper,top=2.1cm,bottom=2.1cm,left=2.4cm,right=2.4cm]{geometry}

### Structure

The structure below is a guideline for the project.
The student is asked to structure the text in sections.
Sections (or clearly marked paragraphs) should:
* state the individual contribution given to the project,
* describe how the tasks have been divided among the members
* describe how the communication between the members have been organized
* describe team organization problems, if any and how they have been dealt with,
* elaborate on what did go well beyond what planned: what are you particularly
  proud about the project outcome,
* elaborate on what did not go as planned, why, what can be done to avoid the
  same problems in the future,
* what are the main technical takeaway tips learned during the execution of the
  project,
* what are the main organizational takeaway tips learned during the execution
  of the project.

## Discussion

The students will have an oral discussion to clarify some points on the project.
The discussion will be structured as a 10 minutes demo presentation and a 10-20
minutes of questions and answers.
